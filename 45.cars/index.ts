//45 : Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. 
// The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should
//  then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with 
//  the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or 
//  an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to
//  make sure all the information was stored correctly.
